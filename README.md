# BetsonApp

##About the project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.
The application uses [The Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/) api to create a search page for movies search.

###Design
Design is minimalistic and made keeping in mind different devices with different screen sizes. 
So it would be less changes in different screens and less time developing UI elements.
###Brand colors
Colors were generated from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) color picker for web safe colors.
###Development
Development is done in component based development way. Angular is component based MVC framework.
In this project I developed 2 components for search page and detail page. Also generated services component for http calls.
I used Rxjs for obseervables, also used SCSS for styles and for creating mixins and variables.
